# Pytorch-DCTTS
A Pytorch implementation of DCTTS ([Efficiently Trainable Text-to-Speech System Based on Deep Convolutional Networks with Guided Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.08969))

Note this is still WIP and I will update once the training is complete and working well.

# Todo
1. batching
2. add regularization such as dropout, layer normalization, etc
3. improve UI/pipeline for loading data and generating custom setences
4. replace lws vocoder with sampleRNN/fft-net/wavenet
